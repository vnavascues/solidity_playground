- [07_Token](07_Token/README.md): the chapter 7 set of contracts before using **Truffle** for their deployment.

## Requirements

### NPM Dependencies

```shell
$ npm install
```

## Optional Requirements

### Solc-select

[Solc-select](https://github.com/crytic/solc-select)

Just in case a snap version of **solc** has been installed in the system and the latest version does not match the contracts one, this project installs **solc-js v0.6.10**. An alternative could be use **solc-select** for using a desired version of **solc**. Please, check its official documentation.
